The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector plays a pivotal role in
India's industrial and economic landscape. It is not just a support system for
larger industries, but a driver of innovation, employment, and entrepreneurship.

#### Key Contributions of Indian MSMEs:

- Contributes **30%** to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Accounts for **45%** of total exports
- Employs over **110 million** people
- Supports large industries through ancillary manufacturing

Despite this, **access to cutting-edge design and analysis technologies remains
a significant hurdle**, especially in early product development phases

### The High Cost of Commercial Engineering Software

Commercial software used for CAD, CFD, meshing, and FEA is prohibitively
expensive for most Indian MSMEs. Here’s a snapshot of the **approximate annual
licensing costs for 20 users** under a commercial license:

### The Economic Challenge for Indian MSMEs

A typical 20-person CFD consulting firm faces substantial overhead costs just to
provide simulation services. With annual software licensing fees alone reaching
approximately **$235,000**, excluding salaries and computing infrastructure, the
financial burden is significant.

Now, imagine an MSME requesting a single CFD simulation project. What would the
cost look like?

#### Estimated Cost of a Single CFD Simulation Project for an MSME

- **Licensing Cost per Month per Person:** ~$350  
- **Monthly Salary of Engineer (India):** ₹50,000 – ₹80,000  
- **Computing Infrastructure Cost:** ₹20,000 – ₹30,000  

Taking these into account, the **total minimum monthly cost per project** comes to roughly **₹1.5 lakhs** (₹150,000).

#### Comparing Simulation Costs to MSME Profitability

The reality for Indian MSMEs is quite stark:  

- **97% of MSMEs are micro-enterprises with turnovers under ₹5 crore**  
- **73% of these earn less than ₹1 crore annually**  

With EBITDA margins for micro enterprises typically around **3% to 5%**, their
average profit ranges between ₹3 lakhs to ₹5 lakhs per year.

Given this context, spending ₹1.5 lakhs on a single design optimization
simulation represents a significant fraction (30%–50%) of their yearly profits —
making such costs **prohibitively high and often unviable** for most MSMEs.

### Why Commercial Software Remains Expensive in India

- Global pricing does **not reflect Indian purchasing power**
- Indian engineers earn 3–5x less than Western counterparts
- India is often treated as a **testing/service hub**, not a core development market
- **Dependency on foreign software limits local innovation**

---

### The Open-Source Advantage for Indian MSMEs

Adopting open-source engineering software can significantly reduce costs:

#### Benefits of Open-Source Tools:

- **60%+ reduction** in software-related overheads
- No licensing lock-ins
- Active community support and development
- Transparency and customizability
- Encourages in-house skill development and R&D

#### Examples of Open-Source Tools:

- **CAD**: FreeCAD, OpenSCAD
- **CFD**: OpenFOAM, SU2
- **FEA**: CalculiX, Elmer
- **Meshing**: Gmsh, cfMesh
