# Introduction: The Backbone of the Indian Economy
The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector plays a pivotal role in
India's industrial and economic landscape. It is not just a support system for
larger industries, but a driver of innovation, employment, and entrepreneurship.

Key Contributions: Contributes 30% to Indiaâ€™s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

- Accounts for 45% of total exports

- Employs over 110 million people

- Supports large industries through ancillary manufacturing

- Despite this, access to cutting-edge design and analysis technologies remains a significant hurdle, especially in the early product development phase.
