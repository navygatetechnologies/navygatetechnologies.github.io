## 🏭 Introduction: The Backbone of the Indian Economy

The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector plays a pivotal role in India's industrial and economic landscape. It is not just a support system for larger industries, but a driver of innovation, employment, and entrepreneurship.

### 📊 Key Contributions of Indian MSMEs:

- Contributes **30%** to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Accounts for **45%** of total exports
- Employs over **110 million** people
- Supports large industries through ancillary manufacturing
- Despite this, **access to cutting-edge design and analysis technologies remains a significant hurdle**, especially in early product development phases

## 📉 The Economic Challenge for Indian MSMEs

Given these software costs, a 20-person CFD consulting company could face overheads of **$235,000/year**, even without including salaries and compute infrastructure.

### 📌 Cost Breakdown for a Single CFD Project (Approx.):

- Licensing Cost per Month per Person: ~$350
- Resource Salary (India): ₹50,000 – ₹80,000
- Computing Infrastructure: ₹20,000 – ₹30,000
- **Total Minimum Monthly Cost per Project**: ₹1.5 lakhs

Yet, **97% of Indian MSMEs are micro-enterprises** with turnovers under ₹5 crore—**and 73% earn less than ₹1 crore annually**.

### EBITDA Margins:

- Micro enterprises: **3% – 5%**
- Avg profit: ₹3 – ₹5 lakhs/year
- **Spending ₹1.5 lakhs on design optimization is often unviable**

---

## 🌏 Why Commercial Software Remains Expensive in India

- Global pricing does **not reflect Indian purchasing power**
- Indian engineers earn 3–5x less than Western counterparts
- India is often treated as a **testing/service hub**, not a core development market
- **Dependency on foreign software limits local innovation**

---
